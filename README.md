## About Me

Hi! I'm Pranav Dudhal, a Data Science student at MIT-EPU with bachelor's degree in Physics with a strong foundation in statistics, an insatiable curiosity for technology, and a creative spirit fueled by ADHD. I’m constantly diving into new tech projects, learning as much as I can, and using my ADHD to explore a wide range of interests. I might forget what I learned last week, but the joy is in the journey, and each project teaches me something new!

## How ADHD Fuels My Creativity

ADHD gives me the energy and curiosity to explore multiple interests at once, making every day a new adventure. Whether it’s building a Discord bot, automating tasks, or diving into financial markets, I use my ADHD as a superpower to fuel my learning and creativity.

- **Quick Learning**: My ADHD helps me rapidly absorb new technologies, even if I forget some details later what matters is the knowledge I gain and the projects I create.
- **Diverse Interests**: I thrive on exploring various fields, from physics and statistics to automation and software development.
- **Continuous Growth**: My journey is not just about the destination but about the joy of learning and the growth that comes with it.

## Current Projects

### 1. Chief Productivity Officer (CPO) Discord Bot
The **Chief Productivity Officer (CPO)** is a Discord bot designed to enhance productivity and organization within your Discord server. It offers features like Pomodoro sessions, study groups, task management, and customizable settings to help users stay focused and collaborate efficiently.

#### Key Features:
- **Study Groups**: Create and manage study groups with customizable roles and voice channels.
- **Pomodoro Sessions**: Start individual or group Pomodoro sessions with configurable durations.
- **Task Management**: Create, track, and complete tasks within Discord.
- **Dynamic Voice Channels**: Automatically manage voice channels for study groups and Pomodoro sessions.

### 2. Market Analysis Automation
I'm automating the collection and analysis of financial data to identify trends and patterns. The aim is to use statistical models to predict market movements.

### 3. Physics Simulations
I'm developing simulations that model physical phenomena, integrating statistical analysis. This project involves using Python or other tools to automate these simulations and visualize results.

### 4. Personal Automation Tools
I'm building scripts and small applications to automate everyday tasks. This project involves experimenting with task automation using Python, Bash scripting, and web automation tools.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: My go-to language for data analysis, automation, building projects, and developing Discord bots.
- **Discord API**: For creating and managing Discord bots.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting and sharing my explorations.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
- **Bash/Shell Scripting**: For automating system tasks.
- **Docker**: To containerize and deploy projects.

## Roadmap

I have a lot of ideas and projects I want to explore next:

- [ ] **Enhance the Discord Bot** with more features and integrations.
- [ ] **Set up a personal website** to showcase my projects and write about my learning journey.
- [ ] **Develop a small web app** that uses financial data APIs to visualize market trends.
